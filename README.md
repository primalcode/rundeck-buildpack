# Cloud Foundry Rundeck Buildpack

## Description
This buildpack makes it easy to install [Rundeck](https://www.rundeck.com/open-source) on Cloud Foundry. 

## Supported platforms
This buildpack is tested with Cloud Foundry 6.36.1-6.37.0. **It only supports rundeck versions >= 3.0.0**

## How to install
Use this repo as your buildpack for your Cloud Foundry app. It [supplies](/bin/supply) Java 8 and rundeck with the version specified by the `RUNDECK_VERSION` environment variable, including all of the specified plugins. In [finalize](/bin/finalize) the uploaded folders are moved to the rundeck application. The finalize step will also create [`startRundeck.sh`](startRundeck.sh) to start Rundeck. 

## How to use
Your Cloud Foundry rundeck application should have a folder structure similar to this one:
```bash
├── etc
│   ├── permissions.aclpolicy
│   └── ...
├── server
│   ├── config
│   │   ├── jaas-login.conf
│   │   ├── rundeck-config.properties
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
├── manifest.yml
├── README.md
└── rundeck-plugins.txt

```
### Required files
To use this buildpack `server/config/jaas-login.conf` and `server/config/rundeck-config.properties` have to be present. 

### Custom rundeck files 
All top-level folders of your application will be copied to the installed Rundeck application. Existing files will be overwritten. 

### Plugins
To install plugins just put a link to the corresponding `.jar` into `rundeck-plugins.txt` (one link per row). The buildpack will download and install them. The file could look like

```
https://github.com/joscha-alisch/vault-storage/releases/download/1.1.0/vault-storage-1.1.0.jar
https://github.com/rundeck-plugins/rundeck-s3-log-plugin/releases/download/v1.0.5/rundeck-s3-log-plugin-1.0.5.jar
```

### S3 Logfile Storage
In order to use the S3 log storage, just add the plugin to `rundeck-plugins.txt` as explained above and bind an s3-bucket to your cf-app. The buildpack will automatically write the necessary configuration.
